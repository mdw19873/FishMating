## 📦 Overview

**FishMating** is a feature-rich and highly configurable Minecraft plugin designed for **1.21.11**. Crafted with ❤️ by `mrsuffix`, this plugin brings your aquatic biomes to life by introducing a unique, seed-based fish breeding mechanic.

Throw seeds into water to attract nearby fish! Fish will detect matching seeds within a **5-block radius**, swim toward them, and become *breeding-ready* after consuming a seed. If two ready fish find each other within **30 seconds**, they breed and spawn a cute baby fish 🐣. After breeding, fish wait **3 minutes** before breeding again.

Every detail can be customized in the `config.yml` — from detection radius to particles, cooldowns, and seed mappings! ⚙️
